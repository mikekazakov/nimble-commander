# Nimble Commander
![](Docs/nc.png)
Nimble Commander is a free dual-pane file manager for macOS, designed with a focus on speed, keyboard-based navigation, and flexibility.  
The project's aim is to blend the user experience of classic file managers from the '80s-'90s with the modern look and feel of Mac computers.
